Demo: use Gradle to develop DukeScript Androids

We created this demo to get you started with developing a DukeScript Android app with Gradle.
Things like dependency management are easier this way, because of the way Google provides it's dependencies.


This project follows the structure of Android apps as created by Android Studio, so
you can open it there and continue developing it, debugging, adding assets, etc.
